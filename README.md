# pythontask

The aim of my code was to allow for a restaurant recommendations page. Didn't quite get there but trying to figure it out

After inputting your name and your area code, you are then redirected based on your location to northside or southside (is actually accurate based on Dublin areas).

You can indicate a preference for a choice of cuisine, and your budget.

It's way too basic and simplistic as it stands, so a lot more would need to go into it to make it useful. Although it takes into account your preference and your budget, it isn't actually redirecting you to different (north vs southside) restaurants based on your location, so that's something I'd like to add, as well as giving a broad range of budget options. For the sake of time and effort, some of the restaurant names are made up so I think it would actually be cool to put real restaurants in based on budget, area, etc.. I don't have any prior experience with Python before this so I'm thinking this could be a cool project to do to improve my proficiency. Maybe this is something I can keep working on that would actually come in handy going forward, to help people to make restaurant choices in Dublin. 

Maybe if it was built properly it's something I could upload to a public and allow people to use, it's not going to save any lives but could be a fun little application to make decision making for eating out a little easier!
