# pythontask

The aim of my code was to allow for a restaurant recommendations page. Didn't quite get there but trying to figure it out

After inputting your name and your area code, you are then redirected based on your location to northside or southside (is actually accurate based on Dublin areas).

You can indicate a preference for a choice of cuisine, and your budget.

Although it takes into account your preference and your budget, it isn't actually redirecting you to different (north vs southside) restaurants based on your location, so that's something I'd like to add to make it more useful. Some of the restaurant names are made up so I think it would actually be cool to put real restaurants in based on budget, area, etc.. I don't have any prior experience with Python before this so I'm thinking this could be a cool project to do to improve my proficiency. Maybe this is something I can keep working on that would actually come in handy going forward, to help people to make restaurant choices in Dublin.
