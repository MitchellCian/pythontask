# pythontask

The aim of my code was to allow for a restaurant recommendations page. 

After inputting your name and your area code, you are then redirected based on your location to northside or southside.

You can indicate a preference for a choice of cuisine, and your budget.

Something seems to be going wrong after the budget is selected, so I'm going to keep working on it and try figure it out.

It isn't actually redirecting you to different restaurants based on your location, so that's something I'd like to add. (Some) of the restaurant names are made up so I think it would actually be cool to put real restaurants names in based on budget, area, etc.. Maybe this is something I can keep working on. Not really familiar with Python so might be a cool project to do to improve my proficiency.
